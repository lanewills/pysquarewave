# pywaves

Fork of PySineWave that generates any kind of wave, as long as they are sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle. Usage is
basically the same as PySineWave, but with the addition of the waveform parameter.

## Usage

Waves with a pitch of 12 and pitch per second of 24 can be created like this:

Sine wave:
```SineWave(1, 12, 24)```

Square wave:
```SineWave(2, 12, 24)```

Sawtooth wave:
```SineWave(3, 12, 24)```

Triangle wave:
```SineWave(4, 12, 24)```

The rest of the usage is the same as PySineWave.
