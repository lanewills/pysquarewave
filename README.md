# PySquareWave

Fork of PySineWave that generates square waves instead of sine waves. I probably only changed one line of code so the commands and documentation are pretty much exactly the same as the OG: https://github.com/daviddavini/pysinewave
In the future I would like to add the ability to use any kind of wave, but it works for my purposes for now.
